# Loan-Eligibility-Predictive-Modeling-Senior-Project-

### About
For my senior project as a Business Analytics major at Drexel University, I strengthened my expertise in model development and evaluation, with a particular focus on data preprocessing for skewed datasets. 

As the main data analyst for the project, I successfully led the data rebalancing effort and model optimization. This project significantly enhanced my ability to **manage large datasets, preprocess complex data,** and **implement machine learning techniques** to address real-world challenges.

**Stakeholders:** Data & Analytics, Risk & Fraud Management

**Skills:** R, Data Preprocessing, Predictive Modeling (Decision Trees, Logistic Regressions, Random Forests)



### Business Problem

The bank needs a reliable way to assess loan eligibility by predicting whether a client is a good or bad borrower based on key financial and demographic factors. By developing two predictive models, the team aims to improve risk assessment and enhance decision-making in the loan approval process.

By developing **Classification Tree** and **Logistic Regression** models in R, Ivy and the team addressed complex challenges like dataset imbalance and model optimization

### **Key Actions**

- **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**: Conducted data type conversions, managed missing and duplicate variables, and performed outlier analysis to improve data quality and model reliability.
- **Dataset Balancing**: Applied advanced techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and cost matrix training to address a heavily skewed dataset, ensuring improved model performance across metrics like precision and recall.
- **Model Development**: Built and evaluated Classification Tree and Logistic Regression models.
- **Evaluation & Optimization**: Conducted accuracy, precision, and recall assessments, achieving consistent results from the training set to the test set.

### **Outcomes**

- Achieved **80% accuracy** in the Logistic Regression model from training to test sets while maintaining high precision and recall metrics.
- Addressed dataset imbalance effectively, enhancing the fairness and usability of the predictive models.
